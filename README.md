# Detect Dog Breed

## This python application is used to determine the breed of the dogs from a dog image.
## The learning phase was performed on the notebook.py using a CNN. The learned model was stored in learned_model.h5.
## The application was implementd as a single web page using streamlit python package.
### The dataset for learning, validation and testins was extracted from kaggle.
### The google clab is used for performing learning process (most computationaly-intensive stage of the project).
